# Nand to Tetris

My solutions for [Nand to Tetris Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
and [Nand to Tetris Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2).

- [part1](part1) contains solutions for all projects of first part of the course
- [Virtual machine](part2/vm) written in golang, implemntation of `project 7: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic` and
  `project 8: Virtual Machine II: Program Control`
- [ButtonPusher](part2/ButtonPusher) is a clicker game for `project 9: High-Level Language`

**Disclosure**: for [ButtonPusher](part2/ButtonPusher) I actively used `gemini-cli` and `JetBrains AI`. Other parts of the
course were done by my own hand and brain :)
